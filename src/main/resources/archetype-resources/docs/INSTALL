Dependencies:
java-runtime-environment (JRE) 5 or greater
apache-tomcat 6.0.32 or greater installed and configured
mysql 5 or greater installed and configured

1. Pre-install
==============================

    Shutdown Apache Tomcat instance if it is running.


2. Installation
==============================

    Run instalation script and follow instructions:
	./install.sh

    In case help is needed:
        ./install.sh -h

3. Users
======================================

    ROLE_USER and ROLE_ADMIN are the only user roles in the system right now.
    To access restricted content, the user must have the role: ROLE_ADMIN.

    There are two ways of control access.

    3.1 Database
    ==================================================

        Insert a new user in auth_user table and his access roles in athority_user table.


    3.2 File: $APP_BASE$/config/users.properties
    ==================================================
        1. The system accepts users through this properties file on the following format:
           #username=password,role[,role][,enabled|disabled]
           The items between [] are optional.
           To add more than one role, just separate them with commas.

        2. Adding or changing existing users
           You can uncomment existing users or create new ones, but any changes to the users file should be followed by a application or server restart.
           The password is MD5 encrypted, so you must generate an MD5 password before adding or modifying any user.
           On linux, use the following command:
           echo -n "<PASSWORD-TO-BE-USED>" | md5sum
           Copy and past the result in the password field of the new or existing user.

4. Apache Tomcat
==============================

    4.1 Installation and Configuration
    ==================================================

    Don't ever auto-install Tomcat from any distribution repository.

        1. Download the last version 6(SIX) from: http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi
        2. Execute: tar xvfz $DOWNLOAD_PATH$/apache-tomcat-6.x.y.tar.gz $INSTALLATION_PATH$
        3. Edit file: $CATALINA_HOME$/conf/server.xml
           Find the UNCOMMENTED line "<Connector" and change the "port" paramenter to the desired port for server.
           Save, exit.
        4. Start Apache Tomcat
           Run $CATALINA_HOME$/bin/startup.sh
        5. Open the following on a browser: http://localhost:<PORT>.

    The initial Tomcat page should appear, otherwise check Tomcat's log at: $CATALINA_HOME$/logs/catalina.out.

    4.2 Making Tomcat start at boot time
    ==================================================

    Need root access for these steps.

        1. Edit file scripts/tomcat and change CATALINA_HOME value to the installation directory of your Apache Tomcat instance.
        2. Copy script to /etc/init.d
           cp scripts/tomcat /etc/init.d
        3. Change /etc/init.d/tomcat permissions to make it executable:
           chmod 755 /etc/init.d/tomcat
        4. Test script by running:
           /etc/init.d/tomcat start
        5. Verify that it is running:
           ps aux | grep catalina
        6. Link script to runlevels:
            6.1 chkconfig: Check if the system has chkconfig to add the script to runlevels
                chkconfig tomcat on

            6.2 If it doesn't, attach script to /etc/rc$.d directories.
                Execute the following commands:
                cd /etc/rc2.d
                ln -s ../init.d/tomcat S90tomcat
                cd /etc/rc3.d
                ln -s ../init.d/tomcat S90tomcat
                cd /etc/rc4.d
                ln -s ../init.d/tomcat S90tomcat
                cd /etc/rc5.d
                ln -s ../init.d/tomcat S90tomcat
                cd /etc/rc1.d
                ln -s ../init.d/tomcat K30tomcat
        7. Now you should restart the server to see if it worked.
